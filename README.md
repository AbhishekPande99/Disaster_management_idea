# Disaster_management_idea
## Description:-


We have thought of creating an android app to predict and manage natural disasters. The app will have the following features:- 

a) The app will locate the user and then provide the weather forecast of that location.
 
b) Then it will use the existing dataset to predict if the weather is safe or not by providing safety index. Also, it would generate an alert if the safety index is less than 20% and would notify the user. 

c) In such condition, we would provide the user with the location of the nearby safe area. Also, we would locate the police stations and hospitals.

d) So this app would help its user to not to panic in such condition and would help them to handle such situations calmly.
